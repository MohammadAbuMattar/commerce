Q: even hitting the api it return 404 after I removed security and mbg
A: package scan not in correct place in EComAppApplication


Q: not able to package mbg when separated and unable to package app since mbg is separated.

even security is not here there's still security problem
I'm suspecting that since i moved the mbg , it couldn't find the mapper
turns out to be package scan caused the 404 error
but now mbg can't be compiled
Unable to find main class
pom package and jar package
jar packaging will cause "Unable to find main class error"

Q: getting java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter error when generating token at login
A:
need a dependecy
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
            <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
            <version>2.3.1</version>
        </dependency>
 Java 9 and later versions, the JAXB APIs were removed from the default classpath, and you need to include the
 javax.xml.bind module explicitly as a dependency. By adding the dependency javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:2.3.1, you are
 providing the necessary JAXB classes for the io.jsonwebtoken library to function correctly.


Q: 403 error code with error "Forbidden".

A: either the account don't have the role or permission. Or the request is send wrong.

curl -X GET -H "THE_LONG_JWT_TOKEN" localhost:8082/admin/logs/2
instead of with the right prefix it will cause code 403.
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer THE_LONG_JWT_TOKEN" localhost:8082/admin/logs/2






Q: when inserting, id keep getting duplicate error, need to insert till current id to insert new one.
For example, article already have 3 in colum already.

 "article": {
      "title": "new article",
      "body": "some thing something"
 }

I have to send request 4 times to insert it and have id = 4.

A: restart database(postgres a few times)  it will generate a gap in id like 20ish. or insert a lot of times.
   still need to find a better way.
   If you manually insert values into a SERIAL column, it can interfere with the automatic generation of IDs by the sequence associated with that column.

   To avoid this issue, you should exclude the id column from your INSERT statement, allowing the SERIAL column to generate the ID automatically.

   Or alter the sequence, it's used in PostgreSQL internal to keep track of id that's been set to use serial.

   -- Modify the starting value of the sequence
   ALTER SEQUENCE article_id_seq RESTART WITH 10000;

   -- Modify the increment value of the sequence
   ALTER SEQUENCE article_id_seq INCREMENT BY 2;

   -- Modify the minimum value of the sequence
   ALTER SEQUENCE article_id_seq MINVALUE 100;

   -- Modify the maximum value of the sequence
   ALTER SEQUENCE article_id_seq MAXVALUE 999999;

   -- Modify the cache size of the sequence
   ALTER SEQUENCE article_id_seq CACHE 100;

another way is to change in data.sql

CREATE TABLE article (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL
);
INSERT INTO article (id, title, body) VALUES
(1, 'Buyer''s guide', 'This article provides a comprehensive guide for buyers.'),
(2, 'Product Comparison', 'This article compares different products and their features.'),
(3, 'How to Choose the Right Product', 'This article provides tips on how to choose the right product for your needs.');

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS article_QA;
CREATE TABLE article_QA (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    article_id bigint ,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL
);

INSERT INTO article_QA (id, article_id, question, answer) VALUES
(1, 1, 'What is a buyer''s guide?', 'A buyer''s guide is a document or article that provides information about a particular product or service to help potential buyers make informed decisions.'),
(2, 1, 'What should I look for in a buyer''s guide?', 'A good buyer''s guide should provide detailed information about the product or service, including its features, benefits, and drawbacks, as well as pricing and purchasing options.'),
(3, 2, 'Which product is the best?', 'It depends on your needs and preferences. This article provides a comparison of different products and their features to help you make an informed decision.'),
(4, 2, 'What are the key features to look for in a product?', 'The key features to look for in a product depend on what you plan to use it for. This article provides a comparison of different products and their features to help you make an informed decision.'),
(5, 3, 'How can I choose the right product?', 'Choosing the right product depends on your needs, preferences, and budget. This article provides tips on how to choose the right product for your needs.');


check it see if they work together then remove the id.

CREATE TABLE article (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL
);
INSERT INTO article (title, body) VALUES
('Buyer''s guide', 'This article provides a comprehensive guide for buyers.'),
('Product Comparison', 'This article compares different products and their features.'),
('How to Choose the Right Product', 'This article provides tips on how to choose the right product for your needs.');

CREATE TABLE article_QA (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    article_id bigint ,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL
);

INSERT INTO article_QA (article_id, question, answer) VALUES
(1, 'What is a buyer''s guide?', 'A buyer''s guide is a document or article that provides information about a particular product or service to help potential buyers make informed decisions.'),
(1, 'What should I look for in a buyer''s guide?', 'A good buyer''s guide should provide detailed information about the product or service, including its features, benefits, and drawbacks, as well as pricing and purchasing options.'),
(2, 'Which product is the best?', 'It depends on your needs and preferences. This article provides a comparison of different products and their features to help you make an informed decision.'),
(2, 'What are the key features to look for in a product?', 'The key features to look for in a product depend on what you plan to use it for. This article provides a comparison of different products and their features to help you make an informed decision.'),
(3, 'How can I choose the right product?', 'Choosing the right product depends on your needs, preferences, and budget. This article provides tips on how to choose the right product for your needs.');

so this way the id sequence is all done by PostgreSQL there won't be issues when inserting with Java.
The id is automatically generated.


Q: similar to automatically generate id.
   have to do with mapper.xml
   if not provided, it inserts default null into PostgreSQL.
   If not it will automatically generate the date but that does count as insert something so it
   won't generate a date.

A: just add it manually
    Date currentDate = new Date();
    article.getArticle().setCreatedAt(currentDate);

    or exclude it in generatorConfig.xml
    <ignoreColumn column="created_at" />
    but it will cause other error because it straight up exclude it in everything.

    or exclude it in mapper.xml  insert to remove created_at
     insert into article (title, body, created_at,
          updated_at)
        values (#{title,jdbcType=VARCHAR}, #{body,jdbcType=VARCHAR}, #{createdAt,jdbcType=TIMESTAMP},
          #{updatedAt,jdbcType=TIMESTAMP})

     but mybatis generator don't offer a generic way to remove it for all the mapper. Only manually remove.
